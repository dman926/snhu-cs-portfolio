- **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client?**
  - The Gaming Room was the client seeking a web-based version of their game "Draw It or Lose It." They required a cross-platform game application supporting multiple teams and players, emphasizing unique game and team names and instance management through unique identifiers.
- **What type of software did they want you to design?**
  - The client wanted a cross-platform game app, "Draw It or Lose It Online," enabling multiple teams with multiple players each, ensuring unique names, and managing game instances via unique identifiers.
- **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
  - Our documentation effectively outlined project requirements, constraints, system architecture, and domain model. The evaluation section examined development platforms and the recommendations provided insights into architectural considerations, showcasing a strong grasp of technical aspects.
- **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
  - The design document served as a clear roadmap during code development, ensuring consistent implementation of requirements. It acted as a reference, preventing oversights, and maintaining a structured approach throughout, aligning development with documented goals.
- **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
  - I would consider expanding the evaluation section by addressing potential platform-specific challenges and solutions, enhancing the document's thoroughness in platform selection and justifications. Developing on cloud technology is platform agnostic in the sense that as long as the platform meets the basic requirements of compiling and an internet connection, it can be used.
- **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
  - We interpreted the user's needs by translating requirements into a well-defined system architecture and domain model, ensuring accurate representation of classes and relationships. Considering user needs is pivotal as it aligns the software with intended purposes, enhancing usability, minimizing misalignments, and ultimately leading to a successful and user-friendly application.
- **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
  - Our approach was systematic, starting with comprehensive requirement understanding and translating them into detailed system architecture and domain model. Techniques like user stories, use cases, and flow diagrams were used for visualization and communication. In the future, I'd continue iterative design, prioritize user feedback, and emphasize technical feasibility, scalability, security, and performance considerations.

- **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
  - Interpreting user needs involves understanding the requirements and expectations of users or stakeholders and translating them into a software program. Creating user stories is a valuable technique in this process. User stories capture user requirements in a user-centric and easily understandable format. They help by breaking down complex functionalities into smaller, manageable tasks. Each user story consists of a short description, acceptance criteria, and priority level. This approach enhances communication between developers and users, ensuring that the software aligns with user needs and goals.
- **How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
  - When approaching program development, I embrace an agile methodology like Scrum. This involves iterative and incremental development, allowing for flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements. I prioritize effective communication, collaboration, and transparency among team members and stakeholders. By holding regular Scrum events such as Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives, I ensure that the development process remains aligned with user needs and project goals. I also incorporate the use of user stories to maintain a user-focused perspective throughout development.
- **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  - Being a good team member in software development involves several key aspects. Effective communication and active listening are crucial to understanding user needs and collaborating with team members. Being open to feedback, both giving and receiving, promotes continuous improvement. Additionally, contributing one's expertise and actively participating in team discussions enhances the collective problem-solving process. Embracing a collaborative mindset, respecting diverse viewpoints, and being adaptable to changes within the project contribute to a positive team dynamic and successful software development outcomes.
